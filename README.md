# Java Linked List Sorting

Welcome to the "Java Linked List Sorting" project! This repository showcases the implementation of a linked list and insertion sort in Java, as well as an explanation of the project's key components.

**Project Description:**

This project is an educational demonstration of essential data structures and sorting algorithms. It incorporates a singly linked list and an insertion sort algorithm in a Java environment. Additionally, it features a "Job" class for managing job execution.

**Key Components:**

- **Linked List:** The singly linked list efficiently moves data from one source to another, making it a suitable data structure for this project's objectives.

- **Insertion Sort:** The project employs the insertion sort algorithm to effectively sort data within the linked list. This sorting mechanism is managed by the `sortedInsert()` function.

- **Class Job:** The "Job" class is designed as an abstract data type for storing various job attributes, including name, CPU time, arrival time, execution time, waiting time, and burst time.

**How to Run the Project:**

1. Place the following files in a single folder:
   - `Job.java`
   - `Node.java`
   - `LinkedList.java`
   - `ProtoType1.java`

2. Compile the Java files in the following order:
   - `Job.java`: `javac Job.java`
   - `Node.java`: `javac Node.java`
   - `LinkedList.java`: `javac LinkedList.java`
   - `ProtoType1.java`: `javac ProtoType1.java`

3. Run the project by executing `ProtoType1.java`: `java ProtoType1`

**Note:**

Please note that this project is primarily educational and might not be kept up-to-date. It is intended to serve as a learning resource for linked lists and insertion sort in Java. Feel free to modify or adapt it for your specific needs.
